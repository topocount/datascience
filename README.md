This Repo will contain all projects relating to my exploration of the field of data science. This will hopefully range from interesting visualizations to Kaggle submissions and projects driven purely by independent curiosity.

**Kaggle**
Kaggle competition code and submission files:
Titanic Survival Prediction code and submission CSV; most recent score: 0.79904, 1049th place

**Introductory Projects**
These projects are used to familiarize myself with data analysis workflow and tools utilized in the process. I'm currently exploring decision trees, linear regression, ensembling, and gradient boosting(used in the titanic Kaggle project).
