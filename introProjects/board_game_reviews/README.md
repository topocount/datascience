This analysis is conducted on a dataset containing board game names and imformation about their reviews, as aggregated by Board Game Geek. In addition to average ratings, features include quantity of people who have put a board game on the wish list, quantity of reviewers, maximum and minimum players needed, playing times, year published and ownership, among others. 

It's insteresting to see how some boardgames stand out clearly as exponentially more popular with both higher ratings and rating quanitites. Also, there are a very large quantity of games that have few reviews, and it would be interesting to analyze games that contain a capped number of reviews. More analysis and chacterization needs to be conducted to extract further insights.

The predictive model is still pretty rough, and needs refining.

TO DO:
* create more plots to better understand the existing relationships between features.
* Analyze a subset of games that fall into a smaller range of review quantities, in order to elminate the outliers that skew the data.
* Create more features.
