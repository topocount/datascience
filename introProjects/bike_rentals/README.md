This bike rentals dataset has served as an interesting way to explore the effectiveness of predictive modelling algorithms, along with feature engineering and selection. It contains bike rental data by the hour and date, along with pertinent weather and season data. The rental data is broken down between casual (unregistered) and registered users. Developing and analyzing a predictive model around registered users on weekdays might allow us to better understand commuting patterns and bicycling adoption over time. Analyzing use by casual users might allow us to understand tourist usage based on seasonality and weather. While analyzing total bike usage and demand is useful, there is definitely further insight to be gained through is added analysis.


To Do:
* create aggregate weather index with temperature, humidity and wind parameters - DONE
* Attempt to predict casual and registered users and see what their output is.
