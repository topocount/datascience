# INTRODUCTORY PROJECTS
These are projects I'm writing to familiarize myself with the data science workflow, from cleaning the data, feature engineering and selection, to choosing and experimenting with different predictive algorithms.

**Bike Rentals**
The goal of this analysis to predict the number of bikes rented in a given hour. Because the dataset is from UC Irvine's machine learning repository, the features are pretty well set up, but there are a few adjustments to be made and features to be tested. 

**Board Game Reviews**
This is more of a charaterization and analysis project. I've made an effort to predict a board games rating, but understanding how and why a board game obtains a certain rating is a more interesting endeavor.

**Stock Market**
This is a rough project involving predicting the price of aggregate S&P 500 on a day to day basis, currently using a linear regression predictor. Much more progress needs to be made to make this a more interesting model.
