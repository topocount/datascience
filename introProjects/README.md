# INTRODUCTORY PROJECTS
These are projects I'm writing to familiarize myself with the data science workflow, from cleaning the data, feature engineering and selection, to choosing and experimenting with different predictive algorithms.

Note: projects contained in .ipynb files contain both commentary and code, and are easily viewable in Github.

**Bike Rentals**
The goal of this analysis to predict the number of bikes rented in a given hour. Because the dataset is from UC Irvine's machine learning repository, the features are pretty well set up, but there are a few adjustments to be made and features to be tested. 

**Board Game Reviews**
This is more of a charaterization and analysis project. I've made an effort to predict a board games rating, but understanding how and why a board game obtains a certain rating is a more interesting endeavor.

**Jeopardy Questions**
This is a data analysis project based around parsing and tokenizing questions and answers in Jeopardy, and analyzing them to find the best way to prepare to compete on Jeopardy.

**Movie Reviews**
Movies and their ratings from sites like fandango, metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes are compared to find relationships between the sites rating systems and examine site rating tendencies.

**Stock Market**
This is a rough project involving predicting the price of aggregate S&P 500 on a day to day basis, currently using a linear regression predictor. Much more progress needs to be made to make this a more interesting model.
